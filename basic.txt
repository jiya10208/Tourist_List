we can't add use props for sibling classes 

props has to be used top to down, and no way around 

what is the difference between props and state
    internal data, owned by component is called state 
    here state is more of component memory and it can be updated by itself 
    updating state causes component to re-render 
    use to make components interactive


    while props is external data, more of fucntion parameters. they are owned by parent component 
    so that parent can pass information to children. 
    they are read only and can not be modified. 

    receiving new props cause component to rerender usually whe parent's state has been updated

    props  is used by parent to configure child component ()



    in react we can not mutate state as react is all about immutate

    we can't go up word while flow of data or side by side (props) there fore we go for lift up state// list up to the closest common parent 

    BY LIFTING STATE UP  we can successfully share one pice of state with multiple component in different positions in the component tree
